Thank you for downloading Notice Me Benpai 2! It's been a long time since I last released a pack (3-4 years?), but I've been working hard balancing school and life in general to get this out. Thirty-two charts with full difficulties, and this time, it's not a mix of FA and stream like my last pack. So hope you enjoy!
