# StepMania Agents

StepMania Agents is a machine learning project focused on training agents to play [StepMania](https://github.com/stepmania/stepmania), an open-source rhythm game where players need to make keyboard inputs in a specific sequence. The project utilizes a clone of StepMania recreated in Unity and utilizes Unity ML Agents to train machine learning agents in the editor. Work for the project was done as part of the final project for the COGS-4420 Game AI course at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.
